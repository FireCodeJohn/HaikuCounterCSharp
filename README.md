# HaikuCounterCSharp
Counts the number of Hiakus in the input file(s). 
Simply run the executable in HaikuCounterCSharp/HaikuCSharp/bin/Debug/net6.0/HaikuCSharp.exe

The program gets .txt files from the working directory as input.  
9 .txt files should already be in the working directory, 3 of which are valid Haikus

The path of the working directory is printed when the program starts if you are unsure where that is
If you add text file inputs of your own to the working directory, put 1 haiku in each text file.  If you attempt to put 2 haikus in 1 file it will be evaluated as 1 invalid haiku with 6 lines.
