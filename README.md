# HaikuCounterCSharp
Counts the number of Hiakus in the input file(s)

Simply run the executable in HaikuCounterCSharp/HaikuCSharp/bin/Debug/net6.0/HaikuCSharp.exe

The program gets .txt files from the working directory as input.  
7 .txt files should already be in the working directory (the path of which is printed when the program starts)

Put 1 haiku in each text file.  If you attempt to put 2 haikus in 1 file it will be evaluated as 1 invalid haiku with 6 lines.
